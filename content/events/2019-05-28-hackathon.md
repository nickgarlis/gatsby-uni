description: "Join us for the fourth iteration of HackGatsbyUni, a 36-hour hackathon hosted on Gatsby Uni's historic campus. This year, we're crossing boundaries, discovering new solutions, and pushing the intersection of technology and society forward. If your project goes off the beaten path, challenges basic assumptions, or is something we'd actually use, we want you to bring it to life here. Every field is fair game - all you need to bring is an idea and the passion to create a proof of concept."
